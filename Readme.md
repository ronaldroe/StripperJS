#StripperJS

StripperJS is a pair of bookmarklets for front-end folks who need to extract content from a site quickly.

While both bookmarklets work a little differently, they have the same end goal in mind: remove everything from the page you don't need.

##Auto Mode

The automatic StripperJS bookmarklet makes a guess at what you'd like to get keep and gets rid of everything else. The automatic version is for semantically written pages where headers are headers, paragraphs are paragraphs, but other elements are marked up with other tags.

##Manual Mode

The manual StripperJS bookmarklet prompts you for a comma-separated list of selectors. The manual version was written for trickier pages where you need get rid of elements the automatic version would keep.
