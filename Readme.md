#StripperJS

This is the early formation of a bookmarklet script that will strip unnecessary content from a web page, leaving only relevant content in the form of paragraphs. The script is intended for front-end devs to be able to easily copy content from a client's existing website for use in their new website.

Fair warning, it doesn't work very well right now, though it certainly removes most formatting and replaces it with paragraphs of text. The bookmarklet isn't ready, but copy/pasting the contents of the js file into your browser's JS console will work.
